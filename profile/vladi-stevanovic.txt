But in modern, distributed architectures, that‚Äôs too little, too late. As systems grow in complexity, teams are realizing that observability needs to shift left‚Äîintegrated earlier in the development cycle to support debugging, testing, and faster feedback loops.\n\nIn this talk we‚Äôll cover the common challenges teams face when trying to implement observability during development and how developers, QA, and platform engineers can all benefit from implementing it before code reaches production. \n\nBy the end of this session, you‚Äôll walk away with a clear roadmap to make observability a first-class part of your development workflow‚Äîaccelerating issue resolution, improving collaboration across teams, and delivering more reliable software faster.\n","tags":["ENG"],"type":"talk","video":"","slide":"","year":"2025"}],"editionName":"Cloud Native Days Italy 2025","editionDate":"2025-06-24"}]}}]]
