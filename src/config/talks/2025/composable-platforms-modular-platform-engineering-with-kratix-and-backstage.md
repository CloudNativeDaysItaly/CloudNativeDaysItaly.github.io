Constructing and managing platforms for diverse teams and workloads presents a significant challenge in today's cloud-native environment. This session introduces the concept of composable platforms, using modular, reusable components as the foundation for platform engineering. This talk will demonstrate how using Kratix, a workload-centric framework, and Backstage an extensible developer portal enables the creation of self-service platforms that balance standardization with adaptability.  

The session will detail platform design for scalability and governance, streamlining developer workflows through Backstage, and using Kratix Promises for varied workload requirements. Attendees will gain practical insights into building scalable and maintainable platforms through real-world examples, architectural patterns, and a live demonstration of a fully integrated Kratix-Backstage deployment.
