What really happens when a Kubernetes region goes dark? The promise of resilience often stops at "multi-zone", but true disaster recovery across sites requires solving problems most platform teams don't discover until it's too late.

This talk reveals the hidden challenges of multi-region Kubernetes that aren't covered in documentation or most architecture discussions. Through live failover demonstrations on , you'll witness critical failure points across load-balancing configurations, health check propagation, storage replication for stateful workloads, and network routing that can make or break your recovery.

Miss this talk, and you might be stuck rebuilding your DR strategy from scratch after your first major outage, or worse, explaining to leadership why recovery took 10x longer than your SLAs promised.
