In this workshop, you'll learn how to deploy Kubernetes clusters using the Hosted Control Plane (HCP) architecture combined with immutable worker nodes, a powerful approach that enhances scalability, reduces control plane resource usage, and strengthens your platform's security posture.

We'll explore how to achieve this architecture using two CNCF projects:

- Kamaji, to manage lightweight, multi-tenant hosted control planes.

- Kairos, to build and manage secure, immutable nodes that are GitOps-ready by design.

Through hands-on work, you'll learn how to generate Kairos artifacts using a web-based UI, configure them to automatically join tenant clusters managed by Kamaji, and lay the foundation for scalable, reproducible Kubernetes infrastructure â€” from core to edge.
