When we think of Cloud Native, we often think of public cloud—but on-premises infrastructure remains an important part of the equation in many instances. Running Kubernetes on-prem often adds complexity, but deploying clusters directly on bare metal—without hypervisors or private cloud layers—introduces an additional layer of operational challenges.

In this session, we'll dive deep into how Cluster API (CAPI) and Metal³ transform bare-metal Kubernetes deployments by bringing software-defined infrastructure principles to physical hardware. We'll cover:

- Automated provisioning of bare-metal nodes using Kubernetes-native APIs

- Cluster API's declarative approach to scaling Kubernetes across physical servers

- Metal³'s integration with Ironic to enable hardware lifecycle management

- Real-world use cases and the challenges of bare-metal operations at scale

If you are looking to modernize on-prem Kubernetes while maintaining full control over your hardware, join us to explore how these open-source tools are bringing cloud-like automation to bare metal.
