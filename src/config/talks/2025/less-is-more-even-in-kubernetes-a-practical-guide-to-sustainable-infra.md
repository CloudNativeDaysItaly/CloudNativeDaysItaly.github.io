It started with a simple question from my kid: “Why does your job need so many computers?” Oof. Turns out… she was right to ask. In this talk, we’ll unpack the sneaky ways Kubernetes clusters waste resources—and what we can do about it. You’ll walk away with a “sustainable K8s toolbox,” a better answer for your own curious kids and friends, and a solid case for why “less is more” isn’t just good engineering—it’s good ethics.
