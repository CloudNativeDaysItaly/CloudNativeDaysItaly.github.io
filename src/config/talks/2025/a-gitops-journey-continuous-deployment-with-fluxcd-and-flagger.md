In this session we will learn how to use FluxCD and Flagger to implement advanced deployment strategies in Kubernetes. As a bonus, we will look into some highlights from Kubecon 2025, the Flux Operator, and a quick overview of the Headlamp Flux Plugin, the latest FluxCD UI.

You will leave this talk knowing more about GitOps, FluxCD, Flagger, and what you need to successfully implement different Deployment Strategies in Kubernetes using these tools (Blue/Green, Canary, A/B testing).
