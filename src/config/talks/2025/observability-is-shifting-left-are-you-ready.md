Traditionally, observability has lived in the world of DevOps—focused on monitoring production systems and detecting failures after the fact. But in modern, distributed architectures, that’s too little, too late. As systems grow in complexity, teams are realizing that observability needs to shift left—integrated earlier in the development cycle to support debugging, testing, and faster feedback loops.

In this talk we’ll cover the common challenges teams face when trying to implement observability during development and how developers, QA, and platform engineers can all benefit from implementing it before code reaches production. 

By the end of this session, you’ll walk away with a clear roadmap to make observability a first-class part of your development workflow—accelerating issue resolution, improving collaboration across teams, and delivering more reliable software faster.
