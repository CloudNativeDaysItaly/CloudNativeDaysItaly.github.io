With over 20 years of experience as a developer, I'm deeply passionate about open source technologies. I've worked with startups and enterprises alike, using open source solutions to tackle real-world problems. Currently, my focus is on edge computing and Kubernetes. I'm excited to share my knowledge with other people.
