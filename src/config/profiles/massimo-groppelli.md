I am an experienced software engineer with over 15 years of experience in the IT industry. I have a consolidated background in Domain Driven Design, Test Driven Development, and Object Oriented Programming disciplines. After 10 years of hands-on experience in Java and JavaScript, I shifted to a DevOps role, fascinated by the cloud-native world. As a DevOps Engineer, I focused on container orchestration, observability, and automation. Today, I lead the DevOps team in the Zucchetti Cloud Department, where I drive Cloud Native migration, shaping the technological landscape of our private cloud.
