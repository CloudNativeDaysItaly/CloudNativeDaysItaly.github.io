A passionate advocate for automation in Kubernetes environments, Gianluca brings a lot of experience to his role as a Principal Engineer at Cisco Systems. Previously, he built his Kubernetes skills at Tigera, the company behind the open-source Project Calico. Now, he continues to contribute to the open-source community by actively maintaining Projectsveltos, a set of Kubernetes controllers that simplify add-on and application management across multiple clusters. His dedication extends beyond Projectsveltos with k8s-cleaner, another Kubernetes controller he maintains. This tool streamlines cluster efficiency by automatically identifying and removing unused or unhealthy resources. In his free time, Gianluca enjoys spending time with his family and participating in fantasy soccer, managing two leagues.
