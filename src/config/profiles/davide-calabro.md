My name is Davide Calabrò, 27 years old, from Italy. After some years as a software engineer, in September 2021 I landed in Mia-Care. I am involved in the development of the Mia-Platform IDP, following the requirements and features needed for the development of Software as a Medical Device (SaMD). In my spare time, I ride my motorbike and go hiking.
