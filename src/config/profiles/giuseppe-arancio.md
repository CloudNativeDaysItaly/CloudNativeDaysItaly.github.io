Passionate about computer science from an early age, I still remember the "love at first sight" feeling with the Internet as soon as I saw the Yahoo homepage. After graduating in telecommunications engineering, I begin my professional adventure working on a research project on home automation, based on Arduino programming, powerline technology and different protocols. I've been a Test Engineer till 2017 when I fell in love again with Kubernetes and the CNCF!
