Cloud Architect at Aruba Cloud | CNCF Kubeastronaut (2024) | Passionate about technological innovation, containerization, and cloud computing.
My cloud-native journey started in 2016 during my Master’s thesis in Computer Engineering at the University of Bologna, where I explored Kubernetes and containerization for deploying cloud-native applications. That research led to publications in top journals such as ACM and IEEE.
Since then, I’ve built my career around the cloud-native ecosystem, continuously expanding my skills through hands-on experience, research, and certifications like AWS Solutions Architect, all CNCF Kubernetes certifications, and Elasticsearch Certified Engineer.
