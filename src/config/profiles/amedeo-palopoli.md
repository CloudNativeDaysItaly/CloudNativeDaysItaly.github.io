Cloud Architect at Aruba Cloud, passionate about technological innovation and expert in containerization and cloud computing.

I embraced Kubernetes in 2016 during my Masterâ€™s thesis in Computer Engineering at the University of Bologna. During this time, I deepened my interest in containerization and the deployment of cloud-native applications on Kubernetes through research studies that led to publications in scientific journals such as ACM and IEEE. The cloud-native ecosystem and its related technologies have been an integral part of my professional journey, supported by continuous learning and various certifications, including AWS Solutions Architect and Elasticsearch Certified Engineer.
