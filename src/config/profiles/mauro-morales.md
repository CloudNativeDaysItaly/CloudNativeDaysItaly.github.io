Hi, I’m Mauro Morales! Born and raised in Guatemala, my tech journey has taken me across the globe—from the scenic Alps of Switzerland to the bustling streets of Berlin, and now to the charming cobblestone lanes of Ghent, Belgium. Since the mid-2000s, I’ve been coding, creating, and sharing my passion for technology. I work as an Open-Source Developer Specialist at Spectro Cloud, where I help shape Kairos, a groundbreaking operating system for edge computing. You’ll often find me at events like FOSDEM, KubeCon, and Open-Source Summit, geeking out about all things tech and connecting with fellow enthusiasts. I also serve as co-chair of the CNCF Special-Purpose Operating Systems Working Group, collaborating with brilliant minds to reimagine what’s possible in the OS space. When I’m not coding or presenting, you’ll most likely find me lacing up my running shoes and hitting the streets of Ghent.
