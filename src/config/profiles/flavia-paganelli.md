I'm a software engineer, entrepreneur, and co-founder on a mission to leave the world a little better than I found it. With a couple of decades of experience building software and teams, I’m currently the CTO at Aknostic and a Tech Lead in the CNCF TAG Sustainability’s Green Reviews working group.

In the early days, I co-authored several O’Reilly books on AWS and built an IoT platform for agricultural growers. Now, my focus is on figuring out how we can leverage technology to make the world more sustainable.

Originally from Argentina, love brought me to the Netherlands, where I live with my family—two kids, two cats, and my partner in both life and business.
