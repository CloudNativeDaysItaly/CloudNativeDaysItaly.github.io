What truly sets him apart is an extensive Personal Knowledge Garden, a Hawaiian shirts collection and a wide range of hobbies (running TTRPG, probability driven optimization for board games, playing harmonica, rapid-prototyping and manufacturing, vector and traditional graphics, motorcycle joyrides),\r\n\r\nHis career has encompassed various roles: from a robotics constructor, graphics designer, analyst and events organizer. He is also well-versed in community efforts and developer's relations. His commitment to enhancing collaboration and fostering a strong community created a testament that makes many peers he worked with still consider him a go-to for technical dilemmas, help with overthrowing the status quo and improving developer experiences.",
