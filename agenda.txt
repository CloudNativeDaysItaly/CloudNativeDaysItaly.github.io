questo workshop pratico di 4 ore, i partecipanti impareranno a fare il deploy di un cluster PostgreSQL e a gestirlo in Kubernetes utilizzando CloudNativePG, l‚Äôoperatore open source nella Sandbox della CNCF. Il corso guider√† passo dopo passo dalla creazione del primo cluster CNPG fino alla configurazione di backup continui e all‚Äôimplementazione dell‚Äôalta disponibilit√† su pi√π cluster Kubernetes.

I partecipanti impareranno l'utilizzo del plugin di Kubectl per CNPG che semplifica la gestione del cluster, dalla lettura aggregata dei log del cluster, all'esecuzione di comandi imperativi. Durante il corso configureranno il backup utilizzando il plugin di Barman Cloud, per l‚Äôarchiviazione su object storage, e impareranno a ripristinare un cluster attraverso la Point In Time Recovery. Bonus: monitoraggio.

Il worksho √® rivolto a DevOps, SRE e sviluppatori che desiderano gestire PostgreSQL su tutte le distribuzioni Kubernete supportate.

Requisiti: ogni partecipante dovr√† seguire la guida all'installazione sul proprio laptop dei requisiti nel README del progetto cnpg-playground: https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cnpg-playground/?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisites0:{"P":null,"b":"U_ZGDeB-7a9-_IRyCQnND","p":"","c":["","agenda"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["agenda",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/ec5d7e66bd3b6cb8.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","link","1",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/d8fbe621d218715c.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"it","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":[["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"57x57","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-57x57.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"60x60","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-60x60.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"72x72","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-72x72.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"76x76","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-76x76.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"114x114","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-114x114.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"120x120","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-120x120.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"144x144","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-144x144.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"152x152","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-152x152.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"180x180","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-180x180.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"icon","type":"image/png","sizes":"192x192","href":"/favicons/android-icon-192x192.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"icon","type":"image/png","sizes":"32x32","href":"/favicons/favicon-32x32.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"icon","type":"image/png","sizes":"96x96","href":"/favicons/favicon-96x96.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"icon","type":"image/png","sizes":"16x16","href":"/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"manifest","href":"/favicons/manifest.json"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"msapplication-TileColor","content":"#ffffff"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"msapplication-TileImage","content":"/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"theme-color","content":"#ffffff"}]]}],["$","body",null,{"className":"__variable_d65c78

secure, immutable nodes that are GitOps-ready by design.\n\nThrough hands-on work, you'll learn how to generate Kairos artifacts using a web-based UI, configure them to automatically join tenant clusters managed by Kamaji, and lay the foundation for scalable, reproducible Kubernetes infrastructure ‚Äî from core to
