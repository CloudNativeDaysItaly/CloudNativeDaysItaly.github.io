impareranno a fare il deploy di un cluster PostgreSQL e a gestirlo in Kubernetes utilizzando CloudNativePG, l’operatore open source nella Sandbox della CNCF. Il corso guiderà passo dopo passo dalla creazione del primo cluster CNPG fino alla configurazione di backup continui e all’implementazione dell’alta disponibilità su più cluster Kubernetes.

I partecipanti impareranno l'utilizzo del plugin di Kubectl per CNPG che semplifica la gestione del cluster, dalla lettura aggregata dei log del cluster, all'esecuzione di comandi imperativi. Durante il corso configureranno il backup utilizzando il plugin di Barman Cloud, per l’archiviazione su object storage, e impareranno a ripristinare un cluster attraverso la Point In Time Recovery. Bonus: monitoraggio.

Il worksho è rivolto a DevOps, SRE e sviluppatori che desiderano gestire PostgreSQL su tutte le distribuzioni Kubernete supportate.

Requisiti: ogni partecipante dovrà seguire la guida all'installazione sul proprio laptop dei requisiti nel README del progetto cnpg-playground: https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cnpg-playground/?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisites8:T436,When we think of Cloud Native, we often think of public cloud—but on-premises infrastructure remains an important part of the equation in many instances. Running Kubernetes on-prem often adds complexity, but deploying clusters directly on bare metal—without hypervisors or private cloud layers—introduces an additional layer of operational challenges. 
In this session, we'll dive deep into how Cluster API (CAPI) and Metal³ transform bare-metal Kubernetes deployments by bringing software-defined infrastructure principles to physical hardware. We'll cover: 
- Automated provisioning of bare-metal nodes using Kubernetes-native APIs 
- Cluster API's declarative approach to scaling Kubernetes across physical servers 
- Metal³'s integration with Ironic to enable hardware lifecycle management 
- Real-world use cases and the challenges of bare-metal operations at scale 
If you are looking to modernize on-prem Kubernetes while maintaining full control over your hardware, join us to explore how these open-source tools are bringing cloud-like automation to bare metal.9:T847,In the age of containers and abstraction, we’re told the operating system no longer matters. That you can run anything on anything. But the reality is more nuanced — your organization might have deep expertise in a specific distro, licensing constraints, or compliance requirements that shape your stack from the kernel up. And the same applies to your Kubernetes flavor of choice. 

But setting up your Kubernetes infrastructure shouldn’t feel like you’re out at sea — catching the fish, cleaning it, and prepping every ingredient from scratch. Instead, it should feel like walking into your favorite poke spot: the freshest options already hand-picked for you, curated with care, and ready for you to assemble exactly the way you like it. That’s the experience Kairos Factory brings to infrastructure — letting you focus on what matters, while still getting a stack tailored to your exact taste.,

In this talk, we introduce Kairos Factory, a web-based builder that lets you assemble secure, immutable Kubernetes-ready OS images tailored to your needs. Think of it as Pok8s — your build-your-own Kubernetes Poke Bowl. Choose your base OS (Ubuntu, Alpine, etc.), pick your Kubernetes distribution (k3s, k0s), toss in your configuration toppings (VPNs, CRDs, mesh configs), and layer on your favorite sauces — TPM-backed boot, full-disk encryption, and other security features.,, 

Unlike opinionated open-source stacks that lock you into their tooling or upgrade paths, Kairos is truly composable — you can swap any layer without rebuilding your world. It’s designed for flexibility without compromise, giving you a declarative, production-grade OS image with full control from kernel to kubelet.,,, 

Through live demos and real-world scenarios, we’ll explore how Kairos enables teams to take control of their infrastructure without abandoning existing know-how or processes. Whether you’re deploying to edge devices, bare metal, or cloud instances, you’ll walk away with a new model for curated infrastructure — not just composed systems.,, 

And maybe, just maybe, a craving for sushi.a:T5b6,Kubernetes is the container orchestration standard. It is expanding to distributed environments across datacenter, on-premises, public clouds. Managing multiple clusters for development, testing, and production in this complex landscape necessitates programmatic solutions. Solutions exist to programmatic create and manage Kubernetes clusters using Kubernetes itself. ClusterAPI is one such popular solution. It provides a declarative approach to creating, managing, and upgrading Kubernetes clusters from a central management cluster. Once a cluster is established, add-ons need to be deployed. In some cases, simply listing all required add-ons suffices. However, add-ons often have dependencies and require specific deployment orders. Additionally, external resources may need to be created and then utilised by applications within the cluster. Solutions exist for programmatically defining which add-ons should be deployed where. Event frameworks handle dependencies programmatically. For short-lived clusters, consistency and velocity are key, while long-lived clusters demand reduced administrative coordination. Consider a scenario where add-ons initially deployed to clusters running Kubernetes v1.30.x need to be updated to a new set upon upgrade to v1.31.x. Application administrators should only need to specify required add-ons for clusters in a particular state. Platform administrators can upgrade cluster and add-on updates automatically happens.b:T4aa,PostgreSQL is steadily becoming the database of choice for cloud-native environments, mirroring its success on VMs and bare metal. This transformation is driven by PostgreSQL’s unmatched extensibility, which powers modern workloads like AI/ML through extensions such as pgvector.
At the heart of this momentum in Kubernetes is CloudNativePG (CNPG)—a vendor-neutral, open-source PostgreSQL operator now part of the CNCF Sandbox. CNPG has matured rapidly thanks to a growing contributor community and its focus on robust Day 2 operations, making it a reliable alternative to proprietary DBaaS offerings.
Running Postgres in Kubernetes is no longer an experiment—it's a production-ready path to database cloud neutrality, offering organisations greater control, cost efficiency, and data sovereignty.
In this talk, I’ll share the journey of PostgreSQL in Kubernetes from its early days to where we are today, and what lies ahead. As a CNPG co-founder and PostgreSQL contributor, I’ll walk you through CNPG’s origins, reasons, architecture, key capabilities, community growth, and future roadmap—giving you practical insights into managing Postgres at scale in the cloud-native world.0:{"P":null,"b":"nBPbbLAj8YDqhK27GCUk2","p":"","c":["","agenda"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["agenda",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/ec5d7e66bd3b6cb8.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","link","1",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/d8fbe621d218715c.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"it","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":[["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"57x57","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-57x57.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"60x60","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-60x60.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"72x72","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-72x72.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"76x76","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-76x76.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"114x114","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-114x114.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"120x120","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-120x120.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"144x144","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-144x144.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"152x152","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-152x152.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"apple-touch-icon","sizes":"180x180","href":"/favicons/apple-icon-180x180.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"icon","type":"image/png","sizes":"192x192","href":"/favicons/android-icon-192x192.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"icon","type":"image/png","sizes":"32x32","href":"/favicons/favicon-32x32.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"icon","type":"image/png","sizes":"96x96","href":"/favicons/favicon-96x96.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"icon","type":"image/png","sizes":"16x16","href":"/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"manifest","href":"/favicons/manifest.json"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"msapplication-TileColor","content":"#ffffff"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"msapplication-TileImage","content":"/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"theme-color","content":"#ffffff"}]]}],["$","body",null,{"className":"__variable_d65c78

Potrebbe sembrare un'attività semplice, ma purtroppo non è sempre cosi, soprattutto in realtà aziendali di medio/grosse dimensioni. Nella realtà richiede tempo e sforzi, creando anche dei potenziali problemi di sicurezza.\nLa soluzione a questi problemi è rappresentata da tool come Kyverno, un policy engine nativo Kubernetes.
